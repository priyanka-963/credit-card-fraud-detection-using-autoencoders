# credit-card-fraud-detection-using-autoencoders
We built a Credit Card Fraud Detection System using an autoencoder trained on normal transactions. It detects anomalies via reconstruction error with a 95th percentile threshold. A Flask app allows CSV uploads for predictions, and an email alert system notifies users of suspicious transactions.
